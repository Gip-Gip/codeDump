REDD's goals are to make compression of non-compressible data, such as
executables and compressed files, easier. It does so by making a bit into a
byte, giving it a chance that the compressor can find a pattern in the bit
orders, and not the byte orders. This does increase the file size 8 times,as
REDD does not actually compress files.
